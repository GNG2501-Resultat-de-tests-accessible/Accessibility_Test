# Description

This React-Native application was made with the intent of helping visually impaired people by reading the result of COVID home tests. The app, ACCESS-19, is Android and iOS compatible, completely responsive and integrates most of the accessibility options available with the users mobile device. The user takes picture of their COVID test, and our Google Teachable Machine trained TensorFlow.js model will process it and determine if the test is positive or negative. ACCESS-19 was made as part of the Introduction to product development and management for engineers and computer scientists (GNG2501) course at the University of Ottawa. It was conceptualised, designed and created by Youssef Chakir, Xavier Lermusieaux, Rami Laham, Mariam Lemghari and Adrian Ghattas.
